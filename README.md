# ProjectEuler_Solutions
A collection of my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems. Mostly in C++, some in Python.
- Most of it is quick and dirty prototype code, with commented out sections, but operational, and mostly readable.
- In some of them a custom BigInt implementation is added in C++, to be able to handle the numbers required. If the problem is rewritten in Python, that implementation is not required, since Python uses BigInt.
